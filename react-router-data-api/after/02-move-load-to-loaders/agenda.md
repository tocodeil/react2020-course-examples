# React Router Nested Routes

- [x] Our Goal: nested tasks

```
tasks      => Show only a list of tasks
tasks/new  => Show a list of tasks on the left side,
              and a form to create new task to the right

tasks/:id    => Show a list of tasks on the left side
              and the details of task #4 on the right
```
