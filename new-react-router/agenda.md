## Automatic Redirection

- [ ] Using <Navigation /> Element
  - Create a special /tasks/new page to create the first task
  - When task list is empty, automatically navigate to /tasks/new

- [ ] Using `useNavigate` hook
  - Allow user to "Delete" a task
  - When a task is deleted, navigate back to tasks index page
